# S3Demo

This is a simple demo website for the [Complete guide of deploying static websites on AWS](https://simpleweblearning.com/tag/complete-guide-of-deploying-static-websites-on-aws/) tutorial series. In the series, the Frontend will be hosted as static website on [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and by the end of the series, a CICD pipeline will be setup. So that a build process will be triggered by code changes.

AWS Services used in the series:
 - [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
 - [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)
 - [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)
 - [Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/)
 - [CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)
 - [WAF](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/)
 - [CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/)
 - [CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
